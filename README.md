# Association Analysis of Supermarket Transactions Using Machine Learning

My goal is to provide a list of items that are purchased together, how often they are purchased together, and how confident I am that they will be purchased together.

In this notebook, I am looking at a small Dataset consisting of 20 transactions from a supermarket and looking to apply two Machine Learning algorithm rules called Apriori Rule and Association Rule. With these rules, I will be able to find the Support (frequency) that each item is bought, the Confidence that I have in an item being bought given that a previous item is bought, and the Lift (strength of my Confidence) for each itemset.

* Title - Association Analysis of Supermarket Transactions
* Goal - To provide a list that show what items were purchased together, how often they were purchased together, and how confident i am that they will be purchased together in the future
* Variables - Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score
* Technologies â€“ Python (Jupyter Notebook)
