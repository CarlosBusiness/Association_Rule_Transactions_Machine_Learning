# Grocery-Rule-Based-Machine-Learning
###### Welcome Everyone!

###### My name is Carlos Jones and today I am showing how to do analysis on Unsupervised data using an ruled based Machine Learning algorithm called Association Rule.

###### In this notebook, wI am looking at a small Dataset consisting of 20 transactions from a supermarket. My goal is to provide a list of items that are purchased together, how often they are purchased together, and how confident I am that they will be purchased together.

###### In order to do this, I will apply two Machine Learning algorithm rules called Apriori Rule and Association Rule. With these rules, I will be able to find the Support (frequency) that each item is bought, the Confidence that I have in an item being bought given that a previous item is bought, and the Lift (strength of my Confidence) for each itemset.

###### I have listed instructions and reasoning for each step that I take below, so please follow along throughout the entire notebook.
